--GameInfo

SlashCoLang["SurvivorInfo"] = [[Welcome to the SlashCo Power Recovery Program.

Your assignment is refuelling and activating two Generators present in an area called the Slasher Zone.

You will need to pour four cans of fuel and insert a car battery into each, however it might turn out not to be an easy task.

An evil entity known as a Slasher will be present in the zone with you. The only way you can successfully complete your 
task is by knowing how to survive.\n\nYou will be dropped off by a helicopter, which will also pick you up after both of the generators have been activated.

If you ever find yourself left stranded without a team, the helicopter can come rescue you prematurely if you signal
it with a Distress Beacon, one of which you will always be able to find within the Slasher Zone.
Rescue will come only if at least one generator has been activated.

Before you set off to the Slasher Zone, you can choose an Item in the lobby in exchange for Points you earn during rounds as Survivor.]]

SlashCoLang["SlasherInfo"] = [[As a Slasher, your goal is to kill all of the Survivors before they manage to escape.

You can track the progress of the Survivors' assignment with a bar which indicates the Game Progress.

Each Slasher has unique abilities which can help achieve your goal in different ways, furthermore, Slashers are divided
into three different Classes, each of which has a different ability kind.

Cryptid:
The abilities of Cryptids are simple and easy to understand. They consist of relatively straightforward ways of
helping you kill Survivors.

Demon:
A Demon's abilities depend on the Items they have consumed, which will be spawned all around the map, and at times the
Game Progress of the round, meaning that a Demon's goals is not just killing Survivors, but also finding and consuming
Items to grow their power.

Umbra:
The powers of Slashers of the Umbra class grow as the Game Progress increases, meaning they are weak at first, but
as the Survivors get closer to completing their assignment, their abilities strengthen.]]
